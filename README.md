# Title
Convenient README Editor

## Description
Designed to simplify the README population process, eliminating hardships of determining required sections and required information in a basic README.  This was created with insight from several video walkthroughs, and study group collaboration, testing functionality of the code to correct errors found in node.

Motivation for this project came because as a fledgling developer, my efforts and thoughts are with the code itself, not with the "cover page" of that code.  Perhaps the biggest benefits are:
- If a deadline is approaching and you lack time to put thought into structuring a README, this editor will provide a basic layout with your responses to the provided questions autopopulating a README file.
- Pre provided license, saving time chasing down a license for your project.

Things I learned due to this project:
- I learned more about how to structure questions in javascript, including multiple choice checkboxes.
- I learned to "writeFile" before using "appendFile".
- I learned more about the new line function.
- I learned how to use html '<br>' functions within the js fs.appendFileSync on a Table of Contents to put each item on a new line.
- I learned how to add a license to a project.
- I learned how to see what the README will look like online by previewing it.
